## Inspiration

130,000 square kilometers of forests are cut down or burned every year - equivalent to 3 times the area of Denmark, a football field every 1.4 seconds, or 100 large harvesters working non-stop. Forests cover 30% of eath's land and supply us with the oxygen we need to survive. If we keep up this rate of deforestation, it is estimated that within 100 years there will be no rainforests. What if all it took to slow this mass extinction was to put yourself in the shoes of a tree?

## What it does

TreeVR simulates what it's like to be a living, breathing tree. With the help of new VR technology, you are immersed in a breathtaking forest in the form of a tree. Look around, take in the nature, and build empathy. Your empathy score is measured based on how long you are a tree.

## How we built it

Unity.

## Challenges we ran into

Creating forest, setting up hardware.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

You get to be a tree.

## What we learned

Unity, Oculus.

## What's next for TreeVR

Upload consciousness to a real tree for full immersion.
